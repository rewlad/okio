/**
 * This class pools segments in a lock-free singly-linked stack. Though this code is lock-free it
 * does use a sentinel [LOCK] value to defend against races.
 *
 * When popping, a caller swaps the stack's next pointer with the [LOCK] sentinel. If the stack was
 * not already locked, the caller replaces the head node with its successor.
 *
 * When pushing, a caller swaps the head with a new node whose successor is the replaced head.
 *
 * If operations conflict, segments are not pushed into the stack. A [recycle] call that loses a
 * race will not add to the pool, and a [take] call that loses a race will not take from the pool.
 * Under significant contention this pool will have fewer hits and the VM will do more GC and zero
 * filling of arrays.
 *
 * Note that the [MAX_SIZE] may be exceeded if multiple calls to [recycle] race. Exceeding the
 * target pool size by a few segments doesn't harm performance, and imperfect enforcement is less
 * code.
